# CognizantChallange

Welcome. This project is a challange I've received from Cognizant.
Project idea

    Create a page where you can pick an issue to solve and solve it
    Create a page where you can check out the top-3 players with most successful submissions


I've decided to do it like that

    Database | T-sql
    Back-end | ASP.NET Core 5
    Database Mapper | Entity Framework Core 5
    Front-end | Angular 11
    Styles | Bootstrap v5.0
    Additional Components | Monaco Editor
    OS | Windows 10 + Ubuntu 20(WSL)

Conlusion

Initial planned time for the project was about 1-2 hours, but it took a lot more which is approximately 6h-7h(not exactly sure) and 90% of the time was figuring out how typescript/angular works, since other technolagies I've used a lot before.
My view is that Angular is alright. It adds whole new layer of interactivness without having to code much, but React might have been a better choice.
